# The Sonic Zeitgeist: A Visual Journey Through Music's Data

**A data visualization project for SD6105: Data Visualisation, exploring the evolution of musical tastes through a four-act interactive data story.**

This repository contains all source code, datasets, and generated outputs for the project. The final deliverable is a 5-minute video presentation that walks through four key acts of data discovery.

### üöÄ Live Interactive Demo

A live, interactive version of the static charts (Acts 1, 3, and 4) is hosted on GitHub Pages:

## üìñ The Four-Act Data Story

This project is structured as a four-act narrative, each answering a key question about the evolution of music.

### **[üé¨ Act 1: The Empire of Genres (Time)](https://zoe033.github.io/SD6105_music_visualization_WU/docs/genre_trends_stacked.html)**
* **Chart:** stack chart
* **Question:** How has the popularity of major music genres changed over the last 100 years?
* **Insight:** This grid clearly shows the decline of Rock, the steady reign of Pop, and the dramatic, unstoppable rise of Hip Hop since the late 1990s. The linked hover-state allows for precise cross-genre comparison.

### **[üé¨ Act 2: The Global Fingerprint (Space)](https://zoe033.github.io/SD6105_music_visualization_WU/docs/top50_music_dashboard_standalone.html)**
* **Chart:** Interactive Plotly Dash Dashboard
* **Question:** In our globalized world, are we all listening to the same music?
* **Insight:** By creating a click-to-update dashboard, we avoid a cluttered map. We see a "Global Average" dominated by Pop and Hip Hop, but can instantly discover the unique "local fingerprint" of any country (e.g., J-Pop in Japan, Latin music in Colombia).

### **[üé¨ Act 3: The 'Gene' of a Hit Song (The DNA)](https://zoe033.github.io/SD6105_music_visualization_WU/docs/hit_song_formula_heatmap.html)**
* **Chart:** Faceted Correlation Heatmap
* **Question:** Has the "formula" for a hit song changed over time?
* **Insight:** Yes. This heatmap proves that the "genes" of a hit song have evolved. In the 1970s, audio features had weak links to popularity. In the modern era, `Loudness` and `Danceability` show a strong, clear correlation with a song's success.

### **[üé¨ Act 4: The 'Universe' of Music (AI's View)](https://zoe033.github.io/SD6105_music_visualization_WU/docs/music_universe_named_clusters.html)**
* **Chart:** AI-Named Interactive Scatter Plot
* **Question:** If we ignore human-defined genres, how would an AI categorize music?
* **Insight:** By running a K-Means clustering algorithm, we discover distinct "music galaxies." To make this understandable, we profiled each cluster and gave it a descriptive name. The chart reveals a clear separation between, for example, the "High-Acousticness Cluster" and the "High-Energy/Dance Cluster."
